# probability_matching
Probability matching task designed on JavaScript

The probability matching task is a simple two-choice decision making task often used in cognitive psychology experiments. The current task has been designed on JavaScript using the jsPsych library (https://www.jspsych.org/). It has been used in lab experiments (data from experiments is included in directory). Paper resulting from this task can be found here: https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2019/papers/0141/index.html. Since the current probability matching task is browser based, it can be conveniently used for online experiments (e.g., on MTurk).

Each of these tasks can be customized to some extent (number of trials, set size in trials, trial duration etc). Results from the task can either be stored locally or on a server (through use of an included .php script). Please download and unzip all the folders in this directory for smoooth functioning ('jspsych-6.0.4' and 'img'). Please cite the paper (https://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2019/papers/0141/index.html) if using the task or the data. If more information is needed, get in touch :)
